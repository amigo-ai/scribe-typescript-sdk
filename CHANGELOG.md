## [0.13.0]

### Added

- `listSessions` now accepts and forwards the optional `created_after` (inclusive)
  and `created_before` (exclusive) ISO date-time filters to
  `GET /v1/{workspace_id}/sessions`, forming a half-open created-at window
  `[created_after, created_before)`. Either bound may be given alone; omitting
  both preserves the previous behavior. Additive and backward compatible.
